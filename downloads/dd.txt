Rapid expansion of a network of mobile test units is now underway, according to the statement, with new units being fielded in the coming weeks and at least 96 ready to be deployed by the start of May. Mobile testing units will travel around the UK to increase access to coronavirus testing, the government announced in a statement on Sunday. The network of testing units will be operated by the military and target vulnerable sites such as care homes, police stations and prisons.
